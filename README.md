## What is Merly Mentor?
At the highest level, Merly Mentor can be thought of a code-based reasoning system. More specifically, Merly Mentor (also
known as Mentor) is a self-supervised system, which utilizes federated learning and an iterative multi-tiered code abstraction
model to help reason about the semantics of code. An overview of Mentor’s system design is shown in Figure 1. Its distributed
learning framework enables it to learn from hundreds of billions of lines of code in a single day on commodity hardware. In
learning from such an abundance of code, Mentor can learn both good and bad code syntax, interesting and uninteresting
(copied) patterns, semantics, and even recommend patches for defects it finds. Once trained, Mentor’s model can be used for a
variety of tasks such as: (i) detecting potential technical debt or defects and recommending fixes in existing code, (ii) grading
the quality of an existing repository, and (iii) guiding programmers through the important aspects of any code repository, to
name a few.

![System Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92695077/163854383-fadec958-7958-4f27-95be-3f4dcd689f5f.jpg)

At its core, Merly Mentor is a machine programming (MP) system that learns how to identify anomalous code fragments in
source code by training on billions of lines of source code across dozens of programming languages. These anomalous code
fragments, also known as anomalies, are often latent defects in the existing code that programmers have failed to identify or
correct. Mentor helps programmers find these anomalies and correct them, thereby improving the overall quality of the existing
software. For this limited release version of Mentor, we only include Mentor’s ability to perform inference (i.e., detect good
or bad patterns) on code. In subsequent releases, we may also include the ability to train new models on other code bases,
including users’ own proprietary ones.

## Installation Instructions

Below we list Merly Mentor’s installation instructions for the currently supported operating systems (OSes). If you previously
installed Mentor without a product key, but now have one, it is safe to run the MerlyInstaller again to register Mentor with
a product key. A product key is a 16 character string, separated by hyphens each four characters and is generated when you
register Mentor on Merly’s website (e.g., 5SA9-HBP2-WRBV-5WA1). If you encounter any trouble with these steps, please
contact support@merly.ai for assistance.

### Linux (CentOS, RedHat, SUSE, Ubuntu), MacOS (M1 ARM, x64 Intel)

Launch the command line interface (CLI) and execute the following command:

```
  mkdir MPCC
  cd MPCC
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merly-ai/MPCC-Universal/main/install.sh)"
```
If you have not already registered with your license key, execute the following command from the CLI, where `<key>` is your product key:
```
  ./MerlyInstaller -k <key> install
```

For MacOS, we recommend running Mentor with iTerm2, due to its support of a broader color scheme than is possible for the
default MacOS terminal. You can download it for free here: https://iterm2.com/downloads.html.

### Windows (64-bit)
Launch ```cmd.exe``` (do not use PowerShell as the below cURL command will not work). Navigate to
your user preferred installation directory (e.g., ```cd C:\Users\Paul```). Then execute the following commands where
```<key>``` is your product key:
  
```
  mkdir MPCC
  cd MPCC
  curl -LO https://github.com/merly-ai/MP-CodeCheckBin-Windows/raw/main/bin/latest/MerlyInstaller.exe
  MerlyInstaller -k <key> install
```

### Updating Mentor with the MerlyInstaller
Mentor is constantly being updated. To update your local copy of Mentor to the latest version including updating all of latest
programming language models it supports, simply run the MerlyInstaller (installed in the above installation steps) in the
following way:

```
MerlyInstaller updateall
```

If you would like to update only certain components, please use the ‘usage’ command from the MerlyInstaller as shown below
for more details on how to update only the components you are interested in.

```
MerlyInstaller usage
```

## Interactive Merly Mentor Execution
In this section we describe how to launch Mentor in an interaction fashion. You must first have Mentor installed to perform the
operations in this section. If you haven’t already installed Mentor, please see the [Installation Instructions](#installation-instructions).
To see the steps to launch Mentor in a non-interactive (i.e., logging) mode, please refer to the [Non-Interactive Merly Mentor](#non-interactive-merly-mentor-execution) section. Please refer to the [Merly website](https:\merly.ai) to determine which type of inference your current product license allows.


### <i>Interactive</i> Mentor inference on a file

MacOS, Linux
```
./MPCC infer -D [code base folder]
```

### Windows
```
  MPCC.exe infer -D [code base folder]
```
  
When run successfully, MPCC will display information that looks similar to the following screen. This shows the progress of MPCC extracting the code DNA from the training data.

When MPCC has loaded its trained model and processed the code DNA, it begins inference analysis on all source code that
it finds in the files of the directory (or subdirectories) you have supplied when launching it. The image below shows an example of
MPCC’s inference progress in analyzing a code repository, how much work it has completed, and how much work is remaining.

<img width="769" alt="launch2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92695077/169102952-dffaab20-4a7c-4c2d-a09b-f4fde0373321.png">

When inference analysis has completed, the Code View screen will appear (see image below), which will allow a user to
analyze the inference results as discussed in the next section.

<img width="769" alt="CodeView" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92695077/169102988-d6b250f8-d681-4167-8f1e-63919cc7c031.png">


## Exploring MPCC's Inference Results

After inference analysis is performed, MPCC will show a user interface that includes source code, with an expression highlighted.
We call this screen the *Code View*, which will be described in more detail in Views section of this manual. The image below provides an
example of an anomalous code example found by MPCC.

<img width="1395" alt="anomaly" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92695077/169103117-e039e3f9-61a7-4c82-a883-ab99abd8eb96.png">


Here's a description of what you'll see on this screen:

**Sort Criteria:** This refers to how MPCC is sorting the list of expressions it has found. This can be via score (a numeric value
assigned by anomaly identification and complexity), or location (sequential code order).

**Class Filter:** This refers to which class of complexity is being filtered in the current view. This can be set from a minimum
value of trivial to a high value of Max complexity.

**Cost Filter:** This refers to a “mental cost” of an expression. This filter can be set from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum
value of 2,000.

**Displayed Items:** This refers to which items MPCC is displaying. It can be set to all expressions, or only anomalous
expressions.

**Hide/Show Known Good:** This refers to whether or not MPCC displays expressions that have been marked by the user as
Known Good.

**Anomaly Identification:** This displays whether or not MPCC has identified the current expression as an anomaly. Non-
anomalous expressions will be classified as “known pattern detected” and highlighted in green. Anomalous expressions will be
classified as “unfamiliar pattern(s) detected” and will be highlighted in green.

**Cost:** This displays the “mental cost” of the current expression.

**Complexity:** This displays the class of complexity of the current expression.

**Source Code Location:** This displays the file location of the source code under review.

**Anomaly/Expression Count:** This displays the count of the highlighted expression, as well as the total expressions found in
this file. If the user toggles the filter to show only anomalies, this will display the count of highlighted anomaly, and the total
anomalies found in the current file.

**Walking Through Code:** You can move forwards and backwards through the expressions by using the left and right arrow
keys, and can page up and page down through the code (by location) using the Page Up and Page Down keys. You can also
scroll up and down through the code by hold the Control key while pressing the up or the down arrow, respectively.

## Basic Commands and Views

In MPCC, there are a number of supported keyboard and mouse commands. In this section we describe those keystrokes and
explain mouse behavior. Perhaps the most important initial command to remember is the *help* command which can be launched
by pressing the character ’h’ on your keyboard. The help command lists all of the keyboard commands, so if you ever find
yourself not remembering a keyboard command, just press ’h’ and MPCC will launch the keyboard shortcut commands. A
screenshot of the help dialogue box is shown below.

<img width="666" alt="Help" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92695077/163893676-f5845122-d222-45db-a756-7d8eca1c63a7.png">

In addition to commands, there are several screens users can utilize to help them gain deeper insights into specific anomalies,
general anomaly information, anomalies by file, anomalies per file, and so forth.

**Code View:** This is the view of all of the code, with the expressions found highlighted. This view is the default view when
MPCC is initially run.

<img width="769" alt="CodeView" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92695077/169103253-67336b12-1317-4722-bf2e-988bf9ac6f6f.png">

**Anomalies View:** Press ‘a’ to switch to the Anomalies view. This view shows all of the expressions in the code (across all
files) that MPCC has determined to be an anomaly, sorted by score. You can move up and down the list using the up and down
arrows, or the Page Up and Page Down keys. Press Enter with an anomaly highlighted to switch back to the Code View of that
specific anomaly.

**Files View:** Press ‘f’ to switch to the Files view. This view shows all of the source code files, with the total number of
expressions MPCC found in each file. You can move up and down the list using the up and down arrows, or the Page Up and
Page Down keys. Press Enter with a file highlighted to switch back to the Code View of the expressions within that specific file.

<img width="769" alt="FilesView" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92695077/169103330-b25af179-4665-47fe-9c90-dbcf5c983b49.png">

**Expressions View:** Press ‘e’ to switch to the Expressions view. This view shows all of the expressions in the current file,
sorted by score. You can move up and down the list using the up and down arrows, or the Page Up and Page Down keys. Also
note that you can toggle the sort between code location and score by pressing the ‘s’ key. Press Enter with an expression
highlighted to switch back to the Code View with that specific expression highlighted.

<img width="675" alt="ExpressionsView" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92695077/169103358-d4b63f25-0e2e-4eeb-90b1-c39c0eab8cdf.png">

**Details View:** Press ‘d’ to switch to the Details view. This view shows the detail of the currently selected expression. The
detail lets you know how many anomalies MPCC identified within the expression, the cost, and the total score. Press ‘d’ to
return to Code View.

<img width="675" alt="DetailsView" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92695077/169103404-853c07a1-55bb-486f-952f-027eee1a4df8.png">

**Help Pop-up:** In addition to the above views, you can press the ‘h’ key in any view to bring up the help screen which will
show you all of the hot keys and their functions.

<img width="666" alt="Help" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92695077/163893697-a8cd66b9-898b-4f84-8db4-92633864b4a6.png">

***Hide/Show Known Good:***

**Options:**
* Hide Known Good
* Show Known Good

**Default:** Hide Known Good

**Toggle:** '9' key


## MPCC Generated Files
In addition to the live (online) user interface, you can also review the inference results offline through four MPCC generated
files. These files are re-generated each time inference is run successfully. These files will be created in the same folder that the
MPCC executable was launched and have the following naming structure.

**[Code Repo].by_file.txt:** This file lists all anomalous expressions (that are not nested if’s) found by MPCC. This human
readable file lists the original anomalous source and its normalized version.

**[Code Repo].by_file nested if.txt:** This file lists all nested if expressions that are found by MPCC to be anomalous. This
human readable file lists the original anomalous source and its normalized version.

**[Code Repo].mpcc.anomaly_list.json:** This file lists all expressions that are found by MPCC to be anomalous, in a machine-
readable format.

**[Code Repo].mpcc.summary.json:** This file contains a summary of all of the files, size, and lines of code reviewed by
MPCC. It also provides a summarized report of the number of expressions, anomalies, and scores found in the source code that
inference was performed on, in a machine-readable format.

## MPCC Configuration
For users who wish to customize their MPCC experience, a JSON file is available to configure MPCC to fit your preferences.

The JSON file is located at the following location:

*%appdata%\..\local\merly.ai\debugging\MP-CodeCheck\config.json*

You can use any text editor to modify the colors, log file locations, and settings. Let’s take a closer look.

**Colors:** These are stored in the json file in hexadecimal (HEX) RGB; simply use your favorite color picker to find the
hex value of the color you’d like, and change the value of the associated item.

For example, you can set *anomaly_background* to RGB *ab852e* to change the highlight color of the anomalous expressions to dark orange.

<img width="675" alt="orange_anomalies" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92695077/169103463-9daf31dd-fb99-4138-a618-355aa8e5dae8.png">

Or, set *highlight_background* to RGB *4a9de0* to change the highlight color of the non-anomalous expressions to light
blue.

<img width="675" alt="blue_expressions" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92695077/169103507-c6562915-d2e7-4528-9596-47b38e24e772.png">

**Log Files:**

You can change the model path by setting the directory associated with: local-db_root_path

You can change the log path by setting the directory associated with: log_path

**Settings:** 

“run_training” – Determines whether or not training should be run before inference on the source code (defaults to true).

“filter” – Determines if items (such as nested ifs) are extracted from the json anomaly list file (defaults to true).
